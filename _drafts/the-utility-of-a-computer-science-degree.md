I love computer science. I'll take a deep dive into algorithm speed and efficiency any time.
Designing the perfect data structure for a project is a task to look forward to. I look forward
to the day when I can put machine learning or artificial intelligence into practice.

But I'm not a computer scientist. What I do can be described in a few ways: programmer,
developer, software engineer. Whatever you want to call it, what I _do_ is write code to solve
problems, generally for businesses. What I don't do is perform research into information
theory or cryptogrophy. I do use the results of others' research every day and am infinitely
grateful for their work.

And I've been doing that for a long time, nearly all of my professional career and for more
than half of my life. And my experience has lead me to be tapped by management to mentor junior
developers a few times. And each time, the junior developer had a degree in computer
science, either a bachelor's or master's. These junior developers were much more educated than
I in computer science. They knew more about efficient sorting algorithms and all
the ways to build a linked list than I ever will.

But, they didn't know how to write software for clients.

Now it's not their fault that this was the case. Given my experience mentoring, achiving a
degree in computer science just doesn't prepare the person for creating software to solve
business problems. And I do understand why a CS degree path was chosen. Most universities don't
have a degree program for Computer Programming or Software Development, just like they don't
have a degree program for Carpentry or Masonry. Universities are homes to academia, and there's
a reason that in some contexts "academic" is a synonym for "theoretical."

I actually considered returning to school to get my degree in computer science, but after my
mentoring experience, rejected the idea. While it might be fun, it wouldn't have any practical
effect on my daily career. With that in mind, if you are currently studying computer science,
or have recently attained your degree in the field, here are some tips for how to create
software that businesses can use to make themselves more efficient and profitable.
