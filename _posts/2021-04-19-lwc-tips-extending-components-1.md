# LWC Tips: Extending Components 1

Lightning-Datatable row-click handling is not supported by Salesforce's base component. [We have to extend the component to achieve the functionality]((https://tython.co/salesforce/development/lwc/2021/03/08/extend-lwc-datatable-with-row-click-handling.html). This is powerful, but there are hangups! Lets examine this unforeseen one of these unforeseen side-effects.

### Recap of the Example

```js
// DatatablePlus.js
import LightningDatatable from  'lightning/datatable';
    
export default class DatatablePlus extends LightningDatatable {

	renderedCallback() {
	    if (this._hasRendered) {
	        return;
	    }

	    const table = this.template.querySelector('tbody');
	    table.addEventListener(
	        'click',
	        (e) => { console.log(e.target.tagName + ' was clicked.'); }
	    );
	        
	    this._hasRendered = true;
	}
}
```

First, we extended the component. Next we attach a targeted listener in a life-cycle method. The "renderedCallback" method gives us access to the mounted elements.

Lets define some columns. We will give the first column a "fixedWidth". According to the documentation (link), this option will enforce a set width.

```js
// DatatablePlus.js
const columns = [
      { label: '', fieldName: 'name', fixedWidth: 200 },
      { label: 'Col1', fieldName: 'Col1' },
      { label: 'Col2', fieldName: 'Col2' },
      { label: 'col3', fieldName: 'Col3' },
      { label: 'Col4', fieldName: 'Col4' },
];
```

Take a look at the result.

### What Happened?

Wait, what? That first column should be considerably wider than the others! It is instead displaying with the same width despite it's "fixedWidth" setting!

It turns out that when extending an LWC, defining a life-cycle method overrides the parent's implementation.

This means that whatever logic contained in the parent method does not run.  If your extended component includes "connectedCallback", say bye-bye to parent's "connectedCallback". In our example, our "renderedCallback" supersedes the original. For Lightning-Datatable, it turns out that some important column-width adjustments happen in "renderedCallback". Our extension innocently wiped that functionality away.

### A Super Solution

Luckily, [there is a *Super* solution](https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/a/325962/68974). We usually call "super" in a class constructor function. Here, we can use "super" as a namespace to access parent properties like life-cycle methods.

```js
// DatatablePlus.js
	renderedCallback() {
		super.renderedCallback(); // Execute parent logic!
		
	    if (this._hasRendered) {
	        return;
	    }

	    const table = this.template.querySelector('tbody');
	    table.addEventListener(
	        'click',
	        (e) => { console.log(e.target.tagName + ' was clicked.'); }
	    );
	        
	    this._hasRendered = true;
	}
```

This pattern ensures the parent logic runs first, followed by our custom logic. Check out the updated result.

Be warned, this is *not* covered in [Salesforce component documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-datatable/documentation).
